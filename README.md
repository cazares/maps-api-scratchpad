![screenshot](http://cazares.github.com/images/gps-calc.png)

So far, this is just a simple page that calculates distance between two GPS coordinates, in various units. Also calculates midpoint between the two points. Calculations made possible by: http://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/latlong.html

Note: you must generate your own Google Maps API key from: https://developers.google.com/maps/

A live demo can be found here: http://cazares.github.io/maps-api-scratchpad/

Click around on the map to move the markers, the page will automatically recalculate distances on every click. Or you can enter your own coordinates and click the 'calculate distance' button. Page currently sized for a mobile browser.
