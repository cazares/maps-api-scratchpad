# Google Maps API Scratchpad

![screenshot](http://cazares.github.com/images/gps-calc.png)

So far, this is just a simple page that calculates distance between two GPS coordinates, in various units. Also calculates midpoint between the two points. Calculations made possible by: http://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/latlong.html

Note: you must generate your own Google Maps API key from: https://developers.google.com/maps/

This page is sized for a mobile browser. But it currently doesn't perform that well on Android 2.3.
